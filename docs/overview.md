# Overview

The overall goal is to build a functional computer from (mainly) 7400-series logic.
This is to be a pedagogical exercise, so speed of operation is not a particular
concern.
Indeed, I harbour some ambitions to include blinkenlights in the design, so
a slower clock is quite desirable.

The basic design parameters are:

- Load/Store architecture
- 8-bit computation
- 16-bit addressing

Ideally the size of the computation and the addressing would match.
Unfortunately,
