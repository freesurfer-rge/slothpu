# Simple Two Byte Addition

# Adds two 2-byte numbers together
# Starts to have structure for a stack frame,
# but does not fully implement a subroutine

# We will use R7 as the 'stack pointer'
# Each stack will be exactly 256 bytes, which
# enables us to track the stack with a single
# register (which contains the _high_ byte)

0 REG SET001 R7 # Location of our stack

2 REG SET000 R6 # Current offset within the stack

# Poke two 2-byte numbers into the stack
# frame. These will be our operands
# A = 357 (101, 1)
# B = 1261 (237, 4)

# Store A
4 REG SET101 R0
6 MEM STORE R6 R7 R0
8 REG SET001 R0
10 SALU INC R6 R6
12 MEM STORE R6 R7 R0

# Store B
14 REG SET237 R0
16 SALU INC R6 R6
18 MEM STORE R6 R7 R0
20 REG SET004 R0
22 SALU INC R6 R6
24 MEM STORE R6 R7 R0

# Have now stored A and B in the 4 bytes starting at R7
