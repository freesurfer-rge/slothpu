During September 2022, I somehow got it into my head to try my hand a building
a computer.
After all, when would be better for such an endeavour than the middle of a
worldwide shortage of electronics parts.
Armed with some hazy memories of CST 1a (25%) and access to wikipedia, I
set out on my quest.
This repo will hold the fruits of my labours.
